# Python Challenges

This repository contains a collection of template projects to help new Python programmers
learn the basics of the language, as well as learning some general programming concepts.

As a companion to this repo, I would recommend
[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html).
This is a free, open, online book. I am not affiliated with it in any way, but simply recommend it
because it covers many important concepts, and can be accessed freely - any teacher, mentor, or
student you work with can access the same book, without having to buy anything.

# How To Use This Repo

Each subfolder in the repo contains a self-contained project. The easiest way
to work with these will be to install [git](https://git-scm.com/), and clone this repo
by running the following in your terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/ChristopherRogers1991/python-challenges.git

In each of the projects is a README.md file that will describe the project fairly
succinctly, and show some sample runs of the program. It is probably best to view these on
GitHub, since it will render the text, iamges, and links nicely. For example, see
the [lights-out readme](lights-out/README.md).

In addition to a `README.md`, each project includes a `main.py` file, which contains template
code, and descriptions of all the steps necessary to complete the project. Python concepts are
explained in comments in the files. I would recommend that as you work through these, you try
to stick to just the documentation provided, the book linked above, and the official
[Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Searching online may produce
"solutions" to questions you have, but may cause you to leap-frog over a basic (and necessary)
concept, for something a little more "magic" (Python has many advanced features that make it
a wonderful language, but I would recommend that you use them only when you've learned the
basics well).

# Where should I start?

I would recommend that you start with the [lights-out](lights-out) project.

# Why does this exist?

When learning to program, one of the most important things you can do is write code. Lots of it.
Every day. The more practice you get, the better you will be. I created these projects to give
some of my students some practice problems, and have decided to open them up to anyone they
might benefit.
