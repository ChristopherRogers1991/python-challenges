# Python Challenges

This repository contains a collection of template projects to help new Python programmers
learn the basics of the language, as well as learning some general programming concepts.

As a companion to this repo, I recommend
[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3](https://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html).
This is a free, open, online book. I am not affiliated with it in any way, but recommend it
because it covers many important concepts, and can be accessed freely. Any teacher, mentor, or
student you work with can access the same book, without having to buy anything.

# How To Use This Repo

Each subfolder in the repo contains a self-contained project. The easiest way
to work with these is to [download a zip](https://github.com/ChristopherRogers1991/python-challenges/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
of the whole project.

Alternatively, you can install [git](https://git-scm.com/), and clone this repo
by running the following in your terminal (for Mac or Linux, use the default terminal application -
for Windows, use the terminal that comes with Git):

    git clone https://github.com/ChristopherRogers1991/python-challenges.git

Once you have either downloaded and extracted the zip, or cloned the repository:
In each of the projects is a README.md file that will describe the project
succinctly, and show some sample runs of the program. It is probably best to view these on
GitHub, since it will render the text, images, and links nicely. For example, see
the [lights_out readme](lights_out/README.md).

In addition to a `README.md`, each project includes a `main.py` file, which contains template
code, and descriptions of all the steps necessary to complete the project. Python concepts are
explained in comments in the files. I would recommend that as you work through these, you try
to stick to just the documentation provided, the book linked above, and the official
[Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). Searching online may produce
"solutions" to questions you have, but may cause you to leap-frog over a basic (and necessary)
concept, for something a little more "magic" (Python has many advanced features that make it
a wonderful language, but I would recommend that you use them only when you've learned the
basics well).

If you do not already have an IDE/text editor that you are familiar with, I would recommend
[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). You will see references to PyCharm throughout the
documentation in the project. If you are using another editor, it should be relatively trivial to
adapt the information for your editor.

# Where should I start?

I would recommend that you start with the [lights_out](lights_out) project.

# Why does this exist?

When learning to program, one of the most important things you can do is write code. Lots of it.
Every day. The more practice you get, the better you will be. I created these projects to give
some of my students practice problems, and have decided to open them up to everyone.
