# Curdle

Curdle is a command-line clone of [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html).
It is a game in which a player attempts to guess a five letter word, within six guesses.
After each guess, they are shown which letters of their guessed word appear within the
correct word - letters that are in the correct location are shown in green, and letters
that are not in the correct location, but are in the final word, are shown in orange. The
player continues guessing until they guess the correct word (winning the game) or run out of
guesses (losing the game).
